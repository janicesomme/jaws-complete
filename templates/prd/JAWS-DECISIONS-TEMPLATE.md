## How to Use This File

When you deviate from the PRD or make a significant architectural choice:

1. Add an entry below with the date and task ID
2. Include the decision, alternatives, and reasoning
3. Note any downstream impact
4. Future sessions will read this for context

**When to add an entry:**
- Choosing one technology over another
- Changing the approach from what the PRD specified
- Discovering a constraint that affects the design
- Making a trade-off (speed vs. quality, etc.)
